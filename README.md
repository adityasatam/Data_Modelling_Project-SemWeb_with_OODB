# SemWeb_with_OODB
In project introduction &amp; module description. it has basically two modules: the first one is the automation part its to create nodes &amp; their relationships in neo4j (neo4j is a graph database) with the help of an OWL file which is created by Protege(Protege is a free, open source ontology tool). so we can also use cypher commands/cypher query lang in neo4j to query this graph data in the second part..we created an interface to query these triplets i.e from the subject to predicate to object &amp; also in the reverse direction i.e from the object to predicate to subject. and since inferencing is the most important part that separates ontology from regular RDBMS so we have also implemented some inferening properties like inverse property &amp; transitive property.
